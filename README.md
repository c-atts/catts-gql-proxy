# catts-gql-proxy

Runs a Cloudflare Worker that proxies Câ€“ATTS recipe GraphQL queries from the IC smart contract canister (IPv6) to GraphQL endpoints running on IPv4. The worker is written in Rust, compiled to WebAssembly, and deployed to Cloudflare's [edge infrastructure](https://www.cloudflare.com/network/). Requests are cached for 10 minutes to avoid overloading the GraphQL endpoints with the many number of requests coming from the IC canister smart contracts.

## Pre-requisites

The worker is configured using the following environment variables:

- `THEGRAPH_API_KEY`: Used for making authenticated requests to The Graph API.

## Usage

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Example query that fetches the number of votes for a specific delegate from the ENS Governance subgraph on Arbitrum.

query_url='https://gateway-arbitrum.network.thegraph.com/api/[api-key]/subgraphs/id/GyijYxW9yiSRcEd5u2gfquSvneQKi5QuvU3WZgFyfFSn'

payload='{
  "query": "query Delegate($id: ID!) { delegate(id: $id ) { numberVotes } }",
  "variables": { "id": "0x534631bcf33bdb069fb20a93d2fdb9e4d4dd42cf" }
}'

# Generate a semi-random cache key
random_cache_key="cachekey_$(date +%s)_$RANDOM"

curl -X POST "http://localhost:8787/$random_cache_key" \
     -H "x-gql-query-url: $query_url" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d "$payload"
```

The worker will forward the request to the GraphQL endpoint in the `x-gql-query-url` header. Special support is provided for the The Graph API, where an API key is required. The worker will replace the `[api-key]` placeholder with the configured API key.

Making requests to the EAS GraphQL endpoints does not require an API key.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Example query that fetches the Gitcoin Passport score for a specific address.

query_url='https://optimism.easscan.org/graphql'

payload='{
  "query": "query PassportQuery($where: AttestationWhereInput, $take: Int) { attestations(where: $where, take: $take) { decodedDataJson } }",
  "variables": {
    "where": {
      "schemaId": {
        "equals": "0x6ab5d34260fca0cfcf0e76e96d439cace6aa7c3c019d7c4580ed52c6845e9c89"
      },
      "recipient": {
        "equals": "0xa32aECda752cF4EF89956e83d60C04835d4FA867",
        "mode": "insensitive"
      }
    },
    "take": 1
  }
}'

# Generate a semi-random cache key
random_cache_key="cachekey_$(date +%s)_$RANDOM"

curl -X POST "http://localhost:8787/$random_cache_key" \
     -H "x-gql-query-url: $query_url" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d "$payload"
```

## Development

### 1. Configure

- Create a `.dev.vars` file in the root of the project.
- Add the following content to the file:

```bash
THEGRAPH_API_KEY=<API_KEY>
```

### 2. Run

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

## Production

### 1. Configure

Set the environment variable using:

```bash
npx wrangler secret put THEGRAPH_API_KEY
```

### 2. Deploy

```bash
npm run deploy
```

## Wrangler

Wrangler is used to develop, deploy, and configure your Worker via CLI.

Further documentation for Wrangler can be found [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/tooling/wrangler).

## WebAssembly

`workers-rs` (the Rust SDK for Cloudflare Workers) is meant to be executed as compiled WebAssembly, and as such so **must** all the code you write and depend upon. All crates and modules used in Rust-based Workers projects have to compile to the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` triple.

Read more about this on the [`workers-rs`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-rs) project README.
